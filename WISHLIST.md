# Priorities / Wishlist:

1. Maps / levels
	- Some way to store a world and layout
	- Tile based?
	- A way to load in and out maps
	- Essentially we need build a top down 2d game engine.

2. Basic Rendering
	- Walls, Floor, Sky
	- Walls should have scale and shading to show depth.

2. Entities
	- Flat sprites, can be updated and interacted with.
	- Sprites can get swapped out based on look direction and animation.
	- Sprites get scaled based on distance.

3. UI
	- Ammo, health, text boxes, selections/choices

3. Textures
	- Wall textures
	- Floor / Roof textures will have to account for stretching to match the walls.
	- Skybox textures can just be a static image that slides / wraps when rotating the player.

4. Tile entities
	- Special entities that are part of the level, eg doors.

5. Better rendering
	- Control over wall height
	- Height maps

6. Parallelization
	- Unlimited power.



9. Actual 3D rendering
	- Would be used in place of flat sprites.
	- Eg: Having a couch in a house or a chest in a dungeon.
