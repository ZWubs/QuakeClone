# Priorities / Wishlist:

1. Maps / levels
	- [ ] Some way to store a world and layout
		- Currently hard-coded.
	- [x] Tile based?
	- [ ] A way to load in and out maps

2. Basic Rendering
	- [x] Walls, Floor, Sky
	- [x] Walls should have scale and shading to show depth.

2. Entities
	- [ ] Flat sprites, can be updated and interacted with.
	- [ ] Sprites can get swapped out based on look direction and animation.
	- [ ] Sprites get scaled based on distance.

3. UI
	- [ ] Elements rendered on top of the game render. EG: Ammo, health, text boxes, selections/choices, ect.

3. Textures
	- [ ] Wall textures
	- Floor / Roof textures will have to account for stretching to match the walls.
	- Skybox textures can just be a static image that slides / wraps when rotating the player.

4. Tile entities
	- Special entities that are part of the level, eg doors.



5. Better rendering
	 Control over wall height
	- Height maps

6. Parallelization
	- Unlimited power.


9. Actual 3D rendering
	- Would be used in place of flat sprites.
	- Eg: Having a couch in a house or a chest in a dungeon.
